            <strong>My favorite moments</strong>
            <br>
            <br> 
            <strong>First time I saw you</strong>
            <br>
            <p>You walked into the gym that I started at. You had a look of determination and grace of someone like I had never seen before. I remember being in awe and Arthur gave me a stern look to knock it off. </p>
            <br>
            <strong>Our first date</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Even though it had its challenges it set the scene for the entrance of the relationship.</p>
            <br> 
            <strong>Our first vaccination (vegas)</strong>
            <p>Vegas was the first time we got to be fancy together. </p>
            <br> 
            <strong> Meeting your family</strong>
            <p> Even as nerve-racking as it was I saw where you grew up, meet your friends, your very nice brother/sister-in-law, and your amazing parents! You shared that part of yourself with me and I was overjoyed! </p>
            <br> 
            <strong>The first IronMon</strong>
            <p>  Leafgreen IronMon where the WI guy won with a Lugia against blue I got to see your face light up with pure excitement and joy. I never thought that someone I would be dating would be into Pokemon and share that same joy with me! </p>
            <br>
            <strong>Showing you devils lake</strong>
            <p>When we were in WI I got to show you one of my favorite places on the earth. This place meant so much to me and you were able to show it to me in a new way. I never thought I would get into a kayak, but you pushed me and I experienced something I never had before. </p>
            <br>
            <strong> First vaccination during covid </strong>
            <p> The first vaccination together at the Salish Lodge during the pandemic was such a relaxing time for both of us. After going through such a hard time we were able to sit and chill. That was a time when I saw you have complete peace and relaxation. I saw you happy and content! </p>
            <br>
            <strong> Seeing you for the first time after Christmas 2022 </strong>
            <p>I have never missed you so much ever in my life! My heart fluttered and I got filled with excitement! I had never wanted to see anyone that much my whole life. </p>
            <br>
            <strong>The time you purposed to me </strong>
            <p> The Salish Lodge that holds so many good memories is the place asked me to marry you.  I could tell you were in a really good mood, but I had no idea why. I remember we went to get food and commented on how the waiter was. Then think "She is very tolerant of me and this is one of the reasons I really want to marry her!". After dinner, we went for a walk along the trail and we were chatting. I again talked about how hot the waiter was and you said "What do you want to marry them?". I said...well you know. Then you got down to one knee and asked me to marry you. I had never been so happy in my whole life! I put the ring on immediately and I never want to take it off! </p>
            <br>
            <p>These are just a sample of the best times of my life with you!</p>

            <strong>Why I love you</strong>
            <br> 
            <p> I love you more than I have ever loved anybody. You are my family and my the most important thing in my life. I love seeing your smile light up when you think about your passions. I love when you teach me about things I never knew like the optimal way of running your dishwasher or the complete guide to classic vines. You love and expect me for me who I am all of me. </p>
            <br> 
            <p>For example, I am sure this website confessing my love is full of dyslexia, but you expect and accept even though by some definitions I am illiterate (I had to look up how to spell illiterate). I love you because you challenge me, and make me a better person. I hope I do the same for you. Every moment with you feels like the best moment of my life. You are the only person for me! You are the definition of perfect! </p>
            <br> 
            <strong>Why I want to marry you </strong>
            <p>You are literally the most important thing to me in this world! There is nothing important to me. I will do anything for you and always will. I have known I wanted to marry you since the third week I knew you!  I see you smile and I get giddy. I see laugh and my heart warms. I hear you speak and I feel comforted. When I am away from you I feel longing and want to be near you. You watch my dump romcoms with me. You are the definition of perfect! </p>
